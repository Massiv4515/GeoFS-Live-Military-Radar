# GMRP Live Radar  

Iâ€™ve always noticed that in many strong forces or organized groups, players get access to advanced tools â€” things like radars and tracking systems â€” that give them a big advantage. Meanwhile, regular players are left to manually dig through **FOOs** or search around on the GEO-FS map, which is slow and unfair.  

So I built this **public radar** for everyone in the GMRP community.  
Now, no matter who you are, you can easily see all active players without struggling through menus or searching endlessly.  

ðŸ‘‰ **Live Radar Link:** comming soon..  

This way, the playing field is fairer: everyone can track, everyone can plan, and nobody is left out just because they donâ€™t have access to private tools.

## Future Plans
Iâ€™ll continue building more tools to make the game fairer and more enjoyable for everyone in the GMRP community. Stay tuned for upcoming projects!
