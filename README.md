# GMRP Live Radar  

I’ve always noticed that in many strong forces or organized groups, players get access to advanced tools — things like radars and tracking systems — that give them a big advantage. Meanwhile, regular players are left to manually dig through **FOOs** or search around on the GEO-FS map, which is slow and unfair.  

So I built this **public radar** for everyone in the GMRP community.  
Now, no matter who you are, you can easily see all active players without struggling through menus or searching endlessly.

This way, the playing field is fairer: everyone can track, everyone can plan, and nobody is left out just because they don’t have access to private tools.

## Future Plans
I’ll continue building more tools to make the game fairer and more enjoyable for everyone in the GMRP community. Stay tuned for upcoming projects!
